Line Follower Resources
=======================

Resources for the Line Follower Competition, Winter 2015

There are two versions of the line follower algorithm in this repo:
- A simple control algorithm with two sensors that just switches direction ([code](https://github.com/byu-mechatronics/line-follower/blob/master/line_follower_bang.ino)).
- A more advanced control system with a PID loop ([code](https://github.com/byu-mechatronics/line-follower/blob/master/line_follower_one.ino)).
